# Patrol Behavior Interruption Analysis

## Issue Description
The NPC patrol behavior is being interrupted by multiple systems, causing:
1. Rapid patrol location changes (every 2-3 seconds)
2. Concurrent movement systems interfering
3. Navigation resets before reaching destinations

## Log Analysis
Key timestamps showing the issue:

```
15:59:36.549 [DEBUG] [PATROL] NPC Oscar patrolling to Grocery Spelunking
15:59:36.632 [DEBUG] [LOCATION_STATUS] NPC Oscar arrived at Grocery Spelunking
15:59:38.648 [DEBUG] [PATROL] NPC Oscar patrolling to DVDs
15:59:40.748 [DEBUG] [PATROL] NPC Oscar patrolling to Red House
15:59:42.848 [DEBUG] [PATROL] NPC Oscar patrolling to Chipotle
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Random Movement Interference
- `randommove` system running every ~2 seconds:
```
15:58:34.552 moving
15:58:45.667 moving
15:58:54.613 moving
```

### 2. Unstuck System Errors
```
15:58:26.842 SetStateEnabled is not a valid member of Part "Workspace.Steakbot.HumanoidRootPart"
15:58:26.842 Stack Begin
15:58:26.842 Script 'Workspace.Steakbot.HumanoidRootPart.unstuck', Line 3
```

### 3. Patrol System Issues
- Location changes happening too frequently (every 2-3 seconds)
- Not waiting for NPC to reach destination
- No cooldown between patrol points

## Recommended Fixes

1. Disable Random Movement During Patrol
- Add behavior priority system
- Disable `randommove` when patrol is active

2. Fix Unstuck System
- Remove invalid SetStateEnabled calls
- Properly initialize hitbox properties

3. Improve Patrol Logic
- Add minimum duration at each patrol point (e.g. 30 seconds)
- Implement arrival confirmation before next point
- Add cooldown between location changes

## Next Steps

1. Implement behavior priority system
2. Fix unstuck script errors
3. Add patrol point duration logic
4. Add proper arrival detection
5. Remove/disable random movement during patrol
