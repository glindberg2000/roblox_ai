"""JavaScript Logging and Execution Issue

Problem Description:
------------------
The enhanced logging in index.js is not appearing in the console, suggesting:
1. The updated code might not be loading
2. The functions might not be executing
3. There could be a caching issue

Current Symptoms:
---------------
1. Only seeing basic logs:
   - "Loading games..."
   - "Added game card: X"
   - "=== Loading NPCs ==="
   - "Populated model selector with 1 assets"

2. Missing enhanced logs:
   - No console.group logs
   - No detailed asset response logs
   - No DOM state verification logs
   - No final state verification logs

Possible Causes:
--------------
1. File Loading Issues:
   - Browser caching old version of index.js
   - Wrong file being served by FastAPI
   - Module import/export issues

2. Script Loading Order:
   - index.js might load before dependencies
   - DOM might not be ready when code executes

3. Path Issues:
   - FastAPI static file serving configuration
   - Wrong path to index.js in HTML
   - Module resolution problems

Verification Steps:
-----------------
1. Check File Serving:
```bash
# Check actual file content being served
curl http://localhost:7777/static/js/dashboard_new/index.js
```

2. Verify HTML Script Loading:
```html
<!-- Should see in dashboard_new.html -->
<script type="module" src="/static/js/dashboard_new/index.js"></script>
```

3. Check FastAPI Static File Configuration:
```python
# Should see in main.py
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="api/static"), name="static")
```

4. Add Version Check:
```javascript
// Add to top of index.js
console.log('Loading index.js version:', '2023-11-20-A');
```

Next Debug Steps:
---------------
1. Browser-side:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check Network tab for file loading
   - Verify script is loaded as module
   - Check for JavaScript errors

2. Server-side:
   - Verify file modification time
   - Check FastAPI static file serving
   - Verify correct directory structure

3. Code Changes:
   - Add version logging
   - Add immediate execution logging
   - Verify module imports

Expected Results:
---------------
1. Should see enhanced logging:
   ```
   === Asset Selector Population ===
   Current game: {id: 61, ...}
   Asset select element: {...}
   Fetching assets from: /api/assets?...
   Asset API Response: {...}
   ```

2. Should see DOM state:
   ```
   DOM at start of population: {
     npcsTab: false,
     assetSelect: "assetSelect",
     ...
   }
   ```

Action Items:
-----------
1. Add version check to index.js
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify file is being served correctly
4. Check for any JavaScript console errors
5. Verify module loading
