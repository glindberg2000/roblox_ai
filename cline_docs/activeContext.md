## Current Task
Implementing multi-user conversation support

## Recent Changes
1. Removed conversation locks
   - Eliminated lock checks in InteractionService
   - Removed activeConversations blocking in NPCManagerV3

2. Analyzed message handling system
   - Current parallel thread processing is sufficient
   - No immediate need for message queuing
   - Deduplication system working well

## Next Steps
1. Future Optimization Considerations
   - Add thread pool limits
   - Implement message queuing when thread pool is full
   - Monitor thread usage in high-load scenarios

2. Current Focus
