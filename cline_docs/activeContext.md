# Active Development Context

## Current Task
Implementing NPC status update endpoint

## Recent Changes
- Added /npc/status/update endpoint
- Implemented new dict-based status updates
- Added health state descriptions (Healthy/Injured/Critical/Dead)
- Added timestamp tracking for status updates

## Current Focus
Testing and integrating status updates:
1. Test endpoint with various health/location states
2. Verify status block updates in Letta memory
3. Confirm LLM can read structured status data

## Next Steps
1. Create APIService in Roblox
2. Implement status update calls from game
3. Add rate limiting and batching
4. Test with multiple NPCs
5. Add error handling and retries

## Implementation Plan
1. Status Updates
   - Format: Structured dict with health/location
   - Endpoint: /npc/status/update
   - Frequency: On significant changes

2. Rate Limiting
   - Batch updates when possible
   - Minimum interval between updates
   - Priority for critical changes

3. Error Handling
   - Retry failed calls
   - Queue updates during outages
   - Log all API interactions

## Testing Status
- API endpoint implemented and ready
- Need to implement Roblox client
- Ready for integration testing

## Current Issues
- Need to re-enable status and group update blocks
- System message pings are currently disabled

## Current State (Critical Issues)

## System Status: BROKEN
- No user messages are being created or routed
- Only system messages and their responses are displayed
- No player messages reach NPCs
- No messages route back to groups
- Cluster system partially implemented but breaking core functionality

## Core Issues
1. Message Routing Broken
   - Player -> NPC routing not working
   - NPC -> Group routing not working
   - Basic chat functionality non-functional

2. Cluster System Problems
   - Partially implemented
   - Breaking core interaction logic
   - Missing constants (CLUSTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL)

3. Conversation Management
   - Locks not working properly
   - State tracking unreliable
   - Multiple conversations possible when shouldn't be

## Critical Files Affected
- NPCManagerV3.lua
- InteractionService.lua
- GameStateService.lua

## Testing Status
- Health system verified working
- Location system verified working
- Ready for API integration
