# Current Task Context

## Issue: System Messages and Chat Display
Currently investigating two related issues:
1. System messages being triggered from multiple places
2. Chat messages only showing in bubbles, not in TextChatService text box

### Known Message Sources
1. InteractionService - Player proximity/range notifications
2. GroupProcessor - Group membership changes
3. Status updates (notifications disabled)
4. Chat system - NPC responses

### Chat Display Status
- ✅ Chat bubbles working
- ❌ TextChatService text box not showing messages
- ✅ Server sending messages via NPCChatMessageEvent
- ❌ Client handling of TextChatService needs review

### Next Steps
1. Track down all system message triggers:
   - Review InteractionService
   - Review GroupProcessor
   - Check for other potential sources
2. Fix TextChatService integration:
   - Review client-side chat handling
   - Verify TextChatService configuration
   - Debug message routing to text box

### Current Progress
- Disabled notifications for status updates
- Confirmed group updates don't send notifications by default
- Need to investigate system message triggers
- Need to fix TextChatService integration
