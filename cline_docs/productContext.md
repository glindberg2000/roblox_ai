# Product Context: NPC Interaction System

## Purpose
- Create natural, dynamic NPC interactions in a Roblox game environment
- Enable NPCs to engage in conversations with players and other NPCs
- Support group conversations and proximity-based interactions

## Problems Solved
1. NPC Awareness
   - NPCs need to know about nearby players/NPCs
   - Must track who is in conversation range
   - Must maintain group/cluster information

2. Conversation Management
   - Handle multiple participants in conversations
   - Manage conversation state and timing
   - Prevent conversation spam/abuse

3. State Synchronization
   - Keep NPC state synchronized with backend
   - Maintain cluster/group information
   - Handle race conditions between updates

## Expected Behavior
1. Proximity Detection
   - NPCs detect nearby entities every 1 second
   - Form clusters of nearby entities
   - Send appropriate system messages

2. Conversation Flow
   - NPCs can initiate conversations when entities enter range
   - Support both 1:1 and group conversations
   - Natural timing and response handling

3. State Management
   - Regular state snapshots to backend
   - Immediate updates for critical changes
   - Maintain conversation and cluster state
