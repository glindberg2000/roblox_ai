## Debugging Case Studies

### Game Creation Form Debug (2024-11-17)

#### Issue Description
Form submission was failing with multiple issues:
1. Form refreshing page instead of handling submission
2. Double submission attempts
3. Directory creation without DB entries
4. Lost changes during git operations
5. BASE_DIR not defined errors

#### Root Causes Identified
1. **Form Handling**
   - Missing event.preventDefault()
   - Form using default HTML submission
   - Multiple event listeners conflicting

2. **API Issues**
   - Missing BASE_DIR import
   - Incomplete transaction handling
   - File operations outside transaction

3. **Git Problems**
   - Branch conflicts
   - Lost working changes during merges
   - Multiple versions of working code

#### Solutions Implemented
1. **Form Fixes**
   ```javascript
   // Proper form handling
   window.handleGameSubmit = async function(event) {
       event.preventDefault();
       // Disable submit button to prevent double submission
       const submitButton = event.target.querySelector('button[type="submit"]');
       if (submitButton.disabled) return false;
       submitButton.disabled = true;
       try {
           // Form submission logic
       } finally {
           submitButton.disabled = false;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **API Fixes**
   ```python
   # Proper imports and transaction handling
   from .config import BASE_DIR
   
   with get_db() as db:
       try:
           db.execute('BEGIN')
           # Database operations
           # File operations after successful DB commit
           db.commit()
       except:
           db.rollback()
           raise
   ```

3. **Git Workflow Solutions**
