# AI-Driven NPC System Development Status (v3.4)

## Current State

1. **SQLite Database Integration**
   - Successfully migrated from JSON/Lua files to SQLite database
   - Maintained backward compatibility with JSON/Lua files for Roblox
   - Implemented database migrations and schema management
   - Created backup/restore system for private data

2. **Improved Asset and NPC Management**
   - Centralized data storage in SQLite with proper schema
   - Maintained JSON/Lua file synchronization for game compatibility
   - Enhanced NPC data structure with proper field mapping
   - Implemented proper Vector3 handling for spawn positions

3. **File Structure Reorganization**
   - Organized project into clear directories (api/, scripts/, src/)
   - Separated private data management from version control
   - Implemented proper backup system for non-versioned files
   - Created clear separation between API and game files

4. **Enhanced Testing Framework**
   - Added comprehensive test suite for database operations
   - Implemented CRUD operation tests
   - Added API endpoint testing
   - Created test database initialization and cleanup

5. **Previous Achievements** (maintained)
   - Structured Outputs for NPC responses
   - Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
   - Robust Conversation Management
   - Improved NPC Interaction and Perception
   - Web-based Dashboard for Asset Management

## Next Steps for Multi-Game Support

1. **Database Schema Enhancement**
   - Extend items table with game_id foreign key
   - Create games table for managing multiple games
   - Add game-specific settings and configurations
   - Implement game-specific asset categories

2. **API Endpoint Updates**
   - Add game context to all existing endpoints
   - Create new endpoints for game management
   - Implement game-specific asset filtering
   - Add game switching in dashboard

3. **Dashboard Enhancement**
   - Add game selection interface
   - Create game management section
   - Implement game-specific asset views
   - Add game configuration management

4. **Asset Management Updates**
   - Implement game-specific asset storage
   - Add game context to asset paths
   - Create game-specific asset validation
   - Update asset migration tools

5. **NPC System Enhancement**
   - Add game-specific NPC configurations
   - Implement game-context in NPC behaviors
   - Create game-specific NPC validation
   - Update NPC spawning system

6. **Data Migration Tools**
   - Create tools for migrating existing data to multi-game structure
   - Implement game data import/export
   - Add game-specific backup/restore
   - Create game data verification tools

7. **Security and Access Control**
   - Implement game-specific access control
   - Add user roles and permissions
   - Create game-specific API keys
   - Implement rate limiting per game

8. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document multi-game architecture
   - Create game integration guides
   - Update API documentation
   - Add game-specific configuration guides

## Current Challenges

- Maintaining backward compatibility while adding multi-game support
- Ensuring efficient data access with game-specific filtering
- Managing increased complexity of game-specific configurations
- Balancing flexibility with maintainability
- Ensuring proper data isolation between games

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Design and implement games table schema
2. Update items table with game relationships
3. Modify API endpoints to handle game context
4. Update dashboard for game management
5. Create game-specific asset organization
6. Implement game data migration tools
7. Update backup/restore for multi-game support

## Long-term Goals

- Create a scalable multi-game architecture
- Implement efficient game-specific data management
- Develop comprehensive game management tools
- Create flexible game configuration system
- Build robust game-specific security measures

## Conclusion

The recent SQLite integration provides a solid foundation for implementing multi-game support. The focus now shifts to extending this foundation to handle multiple games while maintaining the system's current capabilities and performance. The planned enhancements will create a more flexible and scalable system capable of managing multiple games efficiently.
