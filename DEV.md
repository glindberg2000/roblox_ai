### Development Status Report for NPCManager and MainNPCScript (v3.0)

#### Current State

1. **Successful Migration to Rojo and V3 Implementation**
   - The project has been successfully migrated to use Rojo, enhancing version control and easing development.
   - Implemented V3 of the NPC system with improved functionality and AI integration.

2. **NPC Spawning and Management**
   - NPCs (e.g., "Oz the Omniscient") are spawning correctly based on the configuration defined in `NPCDatabaseV3.lua`.
   - NPCs are managed efficiently using the new `NPCManagerV3` system.

3. **Enhanced NPC Interaction and Perception**
   - Implemented an advanced interaction system with AI-driven responses using structured outputs.
   - NPCs can now perceive their environment, including players and major objects (e.g., Cybertruck).
   - Basic command system in place, including "follow me" functionality.

4. **Improved AI Integration**
   - Utilizing OpenAI's API with structured outputs for more controlled and contextual responses.
   - NPCs can generate responses based on their perception of the environment and player interactions.

5. **Basic Memory System**
   - Implemented a simple memory system that stores recent conversations per player.

#### Achievements

- **Modular and Maintainable Codebase**: The V3 implementation has resulted in a more organized, scalable, and feature-rich project structure.
- **Enhanced Environment Interaction**: NPCs can now perceive and interact with their surroundings more realistically.
- **Improved AI Responses**: The use of structured outputs allows for more nuanced and context-aware NPC behaviors.
- **Efficient Object Detection**: Implemented a system to detect major objects without getting overwhelmed by individual parts.

#### Next Steps and Goals

1. **Expand Command System**
   - Implement a robust command parser in the NPC manager.
   - Add new commands: "stop", "wait", "go to [location]", "describe [object]", etc.
   - Create a help command to list available commands to players.

2. **Enhance Movement Logic**
   - Implement a patrol system for predefined paths.
   - Add an "explore" mode for random movement between points of interest.
   - Improve pathfinding to handle obstacles and complex terrain.
   - Implement different movement speeds (walk, run, sneak).

3. **Improve Interaction System**
   - Add gestures and emotes for NPCs to use during conversations.
   - Implement NPC-object interactions.
   - Create a system for handling group conversations with multiple nearby players.

4. **Enhance Memory System**
   - Implement short-term and long-term memory structures.
   - Store important events, player preferences, and key information about the game world.
   - Create a system to review and consolidate memories periodically.
   - Implement "forgetting" of less important or old memories.

5. **Develop Personality and Mood System**
   - Define personality traits for each NPC to influence their responses and behavior.
   - Implement a mood system that changes based on interactions and events.
   - Allow NPCs to form opinions about players based on past interactions.

6. **Implement Task and Goal System**
   - Create a system for NPCs to have their own goals and tasks.
   - Allow players to assign tasks to NPCs.
   - Develop a priority system for NPC actions based on current goals and tasks.

7. **Create Time and Schedule System**
   - Implement a day/night cycle with scheduled NPC behaviors.
   - Create different NPC behaviors based on the time of day.

8. **Improve Environment Interaction**
   - Enhance object detection to include more details about objects.
   - Allow NPCs to use or manipulate objects in the environment.
   - Implement a system for NPCs to remember locations of important objects or areas.

9. **Develop Dynamic Conversation Topics**
   - Allow NPCs to initiate conversations based on recent events or observations.
   - Implement a system for NPCs to remember and reference past conversations.

10. **Optimize Performance**
    - Manage AI call frequency based on the number of active NPCs and players.
    - Optimize vision and object detection systems for larger environments.
    - Consider implementing a local cache for recent AI responses.

11. **Improve Testing and Stability**
    - Develop unit tests for core NPC functionality.
    - Create automated integration tests to maintain system stability.

12. **Enhance Documentation and Ease of Use**
    - Develop comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the NPC system.
    - Create example scenes and tutorials for quick implementation and customization.

13. **User Interface Enhancements**
    - Improve the chat interface for more engaging player-NPC interactions.
    - Add visual indicators for NPC states and interactivity.

14. **Develop NPC Management Dashboard**
    - Create an interactive dashboard for efficient management of NPC properties, interactions, and routines.
